* Just beginning my Data Analyst journey in 2023, been looking for various careers in the field of computer  science. I finished a Diploma in Computer Science and I have barely learnt anything that could essentially help me become a Data Analyst, Maybe the basics of Structured Query Language, other than that pretty disappointed with what I have gained in terms of knowledge. Did manage to get a Google certification in Data Analytics and that was an amazing experience. Looking forward to build something and get started. 

## Sports - Soccer

* I have a bit of an obsession with Sports, especially soccer, lets get into it and I will try to note down why the Greatest of All Time is Cristiano Ronaldo. 

Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi has been a rivalry for the ages. Anyone that follows soccer knows who these two are, well I am going to compare the two based on facts and obviously take into account the proven political affairs that favoured one over the other. 

As fans all we wish for is that our Team Win all games by hook or crook. And in the sport of soccer the team that scores the most goals in a game essentially wins, which makes goal scoring the most important factor in this Sport.

** Atheletism ** 
While Cristiano Ronaldo has been known for having 6-pack abs 365 days a year for the last 20 years obviously indicates that he eats well. But that is not enough to prove that he is a better athlete. CR7 is definetly known for arriving first and leaving last for all training sessions. And these claims are backed by is former teammates. We have never heard that about Messi.
