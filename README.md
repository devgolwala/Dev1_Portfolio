* Just beginning my Data Analyst journey in 2023, been looking for various careers in the field of computer  science. I finished a Diploma in Computer Science and I have barely learnt anything that could essentially help me become a Data Analyst, Maybe the basics of Structured Query Language, other than that pretty disappointed with what I have gained in terms of knowledge. Did manage to get a Google certification in Data Analytics and that was an amazing experience. Looking forward to build something and get started.
